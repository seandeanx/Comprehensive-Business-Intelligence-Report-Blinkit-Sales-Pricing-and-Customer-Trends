🔍 Business Questions & Key Insights
1. Sales Performance & Product Trends
Q1: Which product categories and brands are driving the highest sales and revenue?

Top-performing categories and products were identified using order-item data joined with product prices.

Highest revenue came from [your top categories/brands – e.g., "Beverages", "Snacks"].

Q2: How do sales and revenue trends vary over time (monthly)?

Peak months: July 2023, May 2024.

Seasonal dips were noted in November 2024 due to partial data.

Time-series line charts help visualize monthly patterns clearly.

2. Customer Behavior & Segmentation
Q3: What are the key characteristics of our customers in terms of order frequency and average order value?

Premium customers had the highest average order value and frequency.

Regular users made more frequent, medium-value purchases.

Inactive users had the least engagement.

Q4: How does customer feedback and satisfaction relate to purchasing patterns?

Customers with higher feedback ratings also had higher average order values.

Feedback score trends can help improve loyalty by identifying satisfaction patterns.

3. Pricing Strategy & Profitability
Q5: How do the selling price, MRP, and margin percentages compare across products?

Products with higher margins didn’t always have higher sales volume.

Opportunities exist in mid-priced items with consistent performance and decent margins.

Q6: What is the relationship between pricing strategies (including discounts) and sales volume?

High-discount products showed better movement in some categories.

Scatter plots in the dashboard display price vs. margin vs. units sold to understand trade-offs.

Longer delivery times were generally associated with lower revenue and fewer orders.

Shorter average delivery times correlated with higher monthly performance.
